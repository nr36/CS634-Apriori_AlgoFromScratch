Apriori Algorithm Implementation

How to run the python program:

There are two python programs that needs to be run, CreateDatabase.py to create the database locally and Apriori.py to implement the apriori algorithm on those 5 databases.

Step1:
Run the CreateDatabase.py to store the 5 databases in your local pc/laptop.

Step2:
Run the Apriori.py in the same current working directory so that it can access the database easily and it will print all the output in console.
